Description: Universal transparent and SOCKS5 proxy supporting TCP/UDP/SSL
 Use iptables TPROXY rules to divert traffic to smithproxy listening ports,
 control traffic with access-list, deep SSL inspection and content search
 features, allowing sort of IPS/Application control.
 Apart of TPROXY there is possibility to use smithproxy as SOCKS5 proxy.
 In all modes (TPROXY, SOCKS5) traffic could be proxied with full transpa-
 rency, or you can allow nat.
 It is also able to write traffic to files, which makes smithproxy quite
 good companion while troubleshooting.
