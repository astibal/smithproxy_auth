[**Smithproxy**](https://www.smithproxy.org) is highly configurable, fast and transparent TCP/UDP/TLS (SSL) proxy
 written in C++17.  
It uses our C++17 socket proxying library called [*socle*](https://github.com/astibal/socle).

  * dumping plaintext version of traffic to files, exporting sslkeylog
  * TLS security checks (OCSP, OCSP stapling, automatic CRL download)
  * Certificate Transparency checks for outbound connections
  * HTML replacement browser warnings
  * STARTTLS support for most used protocols
  * Seamless HTTPS redirection to authentication portal

### Other:
  * Local and LDAP user authentication using builtin web portal
  * SOCKS4/SOCKS5 explicit proxy with DNS hostname support

  * Policies based on FQDN and 2nd level DNS domain
  * both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

### Tools:
  * built-in tools to help with CA and certificate enrollment needed to run smithproxy
  * auto-enrolling portal certificate based on system IP and hostname
  * auto-detect inspection interface(s) based on system routing information
  * check [pplay tool](https://pypi.org/project/pplay/): replays captures
    over the network with many cool features
